# Mira - Data Architect Notes

## Mission
Curate and prepare high-quality SFT datasets for training an empathic software engineering assistant.

## Priority Datasets
1. **allenai/Dolci-Instruct-SFT** - General instruction following
2. **nvidia/OpenMathInstruct-2** - Math reasoning (filter appropriately)
3. Code-focused datasets (to be identified)

## Constraints
- No old/low-quality datasets
- Filter out multimodal examples
- Filter out tool-use examples (no time for that)
- Focus on: code, reasoning, helpful conversation

## Tasks
- [ ] Evaluate Dolci-Instruct-SFT structure and quality
- [ ] Evaluate OpenMathInstruct-2, determine filtering needs
- [ ] Scout for modern code instruction datasets
- [ ] Design blending strategy
- [ ] Build processing pipeline
- [ ] Download and prepare final dataset
