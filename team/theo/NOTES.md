# Theo - Eval Engineer Notes

## Mission
Build evaluation pipeline to measure progress toward an empathic software engineering assistant.

## Priority Metrics
- Code generation quality
- Software engineering capabilities
- Reasoning ability
- Helpfulness/instruction following

## Resources
- Built-in evals in this repo
- OLMES repo (user preference)
- Modern code evaluation benchmarks

## Tasks
- [ ] Survey existing evals in nemo_rl repo
- [ ] Identify code-specific evaluation benchmarks
- [ ] Explore OLMES integration
- [ ] Design eval pipeline
- [ ] Create baseline measurements
- [ ] Document evaluation process

## Evaluation Targets
- Pre-SFT baseline
- Post-SFT checkpoint
- Post-RL checkpoint
